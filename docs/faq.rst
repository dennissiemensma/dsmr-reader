Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================


I only pay for a single electricity tariff but I see two!
---------------------------------------------------------
DSMR (and your energy supplier) always read both high and low tariff from your meter. 
It's possible however that you are only paying for a single tariff. 
In that case your energy supplier will simply merge both high and low tariffs to make it look like you have a single one.

This application displays separate tariffs by default, but supports merging them to a single one as well.
Just make sure that you apply the **same price to both electricity 1 and 2** and enable the option '**Merge electricity tariffs**' in the frontend configuration.


Dropbox: Automated backup sync
------------------------------
*How can I link my Dropbox account for backups?*

Choose the following options: (1) **Dropbox API** and (2) **App folder**. 
Then enter a name for your app (3), this will also be used as directory name within the Apps-folder of your Dropbox.

The app should be created in developer-mode. You can generate an access token for yourself by clicking the **"Generate"** button somewhere below.

Copy the generated access token to the DSMR-reader settings for the Dropbox-configuration. The DSMR-reader application should sync any backups created shortly.


Mindergas.nl: Automated gas meter position export
-------------------------------------------------
*How can I link my mindergas.nl account?*

Make sure you have a Mindergas.nl-account or `signup for one <https://www.mindergas.nl/users/sign_up>`_. 
Now go to "`Meterstand API <https://www.mindergas.nl/member/api>`_" and click on the button located below **"Authenticatietoken"**.

Copy the authentication token generated and paste in into the DSMR-reader settings for the Mindergas.nl-configuration.
Obviously the export only works when there are any gas readings at all and you have ticked the 'export' checkbox in the Mindergas.nl-configuration as well.

Please note that due to policies of mindergas.nl it's not allowed to retroactively upload meter positions using the API. 
Therefor this is not supported by the application. You can however, enter them manually on their website.

Recalculate prices retroactively
--------------------------------
*I've adjusted my energy prices but there are no changes! How can I regenerate them with my new prices?*

Statistics for each day are generated once, the day after. However, you can flush your statistics by executing:

``./manage.py dsmr_stats_clear_statistics --ack-to-delete-my-data``

The application will delete all statistics and (slowly) regenerate them in the background. Just make sure the source data is still there.
